# A TikTok clone with less functionality
A project I made as a Vue.js first ever practise, using TikTok API and watching all those cringy videos

Link to project: TBD

## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js

The project was made by creating several Vue pages, Router, Mixins and Directives. The designs were done beforehand to ensure a better look.

## Optimizations
(optional)

The profile part of user page could be combined with profile part on trending page, but I'm not sure if it's efficient to do so. 
The API used is a free version that can't handle a lot of requests. (Not mine API is in code currently)

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
