# A TikTok clone with less functionality
A project I made as a Vue.js first ever practise, using TikTok API and watching all those cringy videos

## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js

The project was made by creating several Vue pages, Router, Mixins and Directives. The designs were done beforehand to ensure a better look.

## Optimizations
(optional)

The profile part of user page could be combined with profile part on trending page, but I'm not sure if it's efficient to do so. 
The API used is partionally broken, but was functioning at the time of writing the code. So all requests are now changed to placeholder values.

## Dependencies
```
Vue3
Vue-router@next
axios
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
